v1.0.0::

[x] -----
unique stamp for storage accounts as an arg/foggfile

[x] -----
standardise all names into a separate module

[x] -----
[x] change "tag" to be "role"
[x] change "pretag" to be "platform" (and be optional, and main vnet forced to rg-less resource group name)
[x] platform should be arguments/foggfile (not in template/objs)

> ["platform"-]"role"[-vm1]

[x] -----
remove "Legacy" stuff for vms and public ips

[x] -----
have a vnet type/step, and only make vnetname/rg/address/subnet-addresses mandatory in foggfile if vms/vpn are in the template
    - vnet name (maybe time for variable name? "@{ResourceGroupName}-vnet")
    - vnet mask
    - subnet masks
    - with validation
    - GatewaySubnet should not be standardised

[x] -----
validate that the azure location passed is a valid location

[x] -----
don't request VM creds when template has no VMs in it

[x] -----
sa step for creating extra storage accounts
    - with validation

[x] -----
allow creation of vms from vhds
    - from a vhd in an existing sa in the same rg

[x] -----
allow create of vms from a template image file

[x] -----
if vm count is null or not supplied, just assume "1", rather than fail

[ ] -----
have option to create vms, (sysprep?), download vhds, then remove resource group

[x] -----
unload imported modules after running - no sense keeping them imported afterwards

[x] -----
tags on resources?
partially done - logic in place, just needs adding to Foggfile and main Parameters

[x] -----
Run "Remove-AzureRmAccount" on completion

[-] -----
Add Redis Cache step
    [x] - subnets have now changed to be "<platform>-<role>-<type>-snet"
    [ ] - update readme/wiki and examples for new subnet format
    [x] - subnets now don't have to be supplied when using existing vnets

    [x] - if using a subnet - make sure firewall updates redis whitelist and nsg
    [x] - redis info obj should include: port (ssl or non-ssl), static IP, access key, url/name
    [-] - attempt to put validation checks in for premium on config settings?

    [x] - when updating, check what is being updated (does not affect creating new caches)
        --> size (or sku+size for premium)
        --> sku (unless like above was premium)
        --> all other properties

[ ] -----
yum and apt-get provisioners?

[x] -----
managed disks
    - os/data disks

[x] -----
role uniqueness is not global in template - it should be unique to each type
    - you can have "data/vm" and "data/sa", but you can't have "data/sa" again

[ ] -----
move creation of global vnet (unless re-using one) to be a defined step
    - "vm" type now has a "vnet" section, to define "name" and "rg" (optional) - but how to get newly created vnet-snets into snet list?

[-] -----
    - update all examples/readme
    - update wiki

[-] -----
    [x] - vnet example
    [x] - storage account example
    [x] - vm managed example
    [x] - vm image example
    [x] - vm vhd example
    [ ] - redis example
